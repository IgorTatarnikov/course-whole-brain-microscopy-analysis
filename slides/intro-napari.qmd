## Opening Napari

```{.bash}
napari
```

![](img/blank-napari-ui.png){alt="A screenshot of the default Napari user 
interface"}

## Opening images

`File > Open Files(s)`, then navigate to `calcium imaging folder` and open `translation1_00001_ce.tif`

## Napari's User interface


![](img/ui-sections-napari.png){alt="A screenshot of Napari with the main user 
interface sections labelled"}

## Main menu

![](img/ui-sections-napari.png){alt="A screenshot of Napari with the main user 
interface sections labelled"}

::: {.notes}
We already used the main menu in the last section to view the BrainGlobe plugins. The 
main menu contains various commands for opening images, changing preferences and 
installing plugins (we'll see more of these options in later episodes).
:::

## Canvas

Try moving around the image with the following commands:
```
Pan - Click and drag
Zoom - Scroll in/out
```

## Dimension sliders


![](img/dim-slider-closeup.png){alt="Closeup of Napari's dimension slider with
labels" width='80%'}

![](img/dim-slider-0.png){width="30%" alt="Three screenshots of the cells image in napari, at 
different z depths"}
![](img/dim-slider-50.png){width="30%" alt="Three screenshots of the cells image in napari, at 
different z depths"}
![](img/dim-slider-100.png){width="30%" alt="Three screenshots of the cells image in napari, at 
different z depths"}

::: {.notes}
Dimension sliders appear at the bottom of the canvas depending on the type of 
image displayed. For example, here we have a 3D image of some cells, which 
consists of a stack of 2D images. If we drag the slider at the bottom of the 
image, we move up and down in this stack:

Pressing the arrow buttons at either end of the slider steps through one slice 
at a time. Also, pressing the 'play' button at the very left of the slider moves 
automatically through the stack until pressed again.

We will see in later episodes that more sliders can appear if our image has more 
dimensions (e.g. time series, or further channels).

## Viewer buttons {.smaller}

The viewer buttons (the row of buttons at the bottom left of Napari) control 
various aspects of the Napari viewer:

:::: {.columns}

## Layer list

![](img/cells-napari.png){alt="A screenshot of a some fluorescent cells"}

::: {.notes}
We can show/hide each layer by clicking the eye icon on the left side of their 
row. 
We can also rename them by double clicking on the row.

We can change the order of layers by dragging and dropping items in the layer 
list. For example, try dragging the membrane layer above the nuclei. You should 
see the nuclei disappear from the viewer (as they are now hidden by the membrane 
image on top).

Now that we've seen the main controls for the viewer, let's look at the layer 
list. 'Layers' are how Napari displays multiple items together in the viewer. 
For example, currently our layer list contains two items - 'nuclei' and 
'membrane'. These are both `Image` layers and are displayed in order, with 
the nuclei on top and membrane underneath.

Here we only have `Image` layers, but there are many more types like `Points`, 
`Shapes` and `Labels`, some of which we will see [later in the episode
](#layer-buttons).
:::

## Layer controls

This area shows controls only for the currently selected layer (i.e. the one that is highlighted in blue in the layer 
list).

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width=30%}
 - Opacity  
 - Contrast limits 
 - ...
:::

::: {.column width=60%}
![](img/cells-napari.png){alt="A screenshot of a some fluorescent cells"}
:::
::::

::: {.notes}

This changes the opacity of the layer - lower values are more transparent. For 
example, reducing the opacity of the membrane layer (if it is still on top of 
the nuclei), allows us to see the nuclei again.

briefly - the contrast 
limits adjust what parts of the image we can see and how bright they appear in 
the viewer. Moving the left node adjusts what is shown as fully black, while 
moving the right node adjusts what is shown as fully bright. This doesn't change the values
in the image, just how they are displayed.

## Layer buttons

Create and remove.

## Other layer types

Note that there are some layer types that can't be added via clicking buttons
in the user interface, like

* [surfaces](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/surface.html),
* [tracks](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/tracks.html) and 
* [vectors](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/vectors.html). 

These require 
calling python commands in Napari's console or an external python script.

## Key points 

- Napari's user interface is split into a few main sections including the 
canvas, layer list, layer controls...
- Layers can be of different types e.g. `Image`, `Point`, `Label`
- Different layer types have different layer controls
